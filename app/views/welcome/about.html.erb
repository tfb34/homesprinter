<h1 style="text-align: left;padding-left: 1em">About</h1>
<div style="max-width:500px;padding:1em;">
<p>My name is Thalia. This is a pet project of mine
I've been working on for l~e~a~r~n~i~n~g purposes. Design wasn't my focus here so, I looked to Trulia for the design layout. </p>

<h3>What can I do?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Search for houses in the Jersey City area</li>
	<li>Create a user account</li>
	<li>Keep track of the homes you like</li>
	<li>Narrow your search through the use of filters</li>
</ul>

<h3>Are these house details legit?</h3>
Not really. Listings were curated in late 2018, <i>aaand</i> have not been updated since. 

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>My goal was to cement my front-end skills, and utilize reactjs to render search results and an interactive user interface. Along the way I got ambitious. I wanted users to also be able to save homes they liked so I used Rails for the backend.
